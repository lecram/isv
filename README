isv - interactive service supervision
=====================================

This is a terminal user interface (TUI) for Runit service control.
It should also be compatible with daemontools, but I haven't tested that.
It's intended  to be a friendlier  version of Runit's sv  and daemontools' svc
programs.


Screenshot
----------

    $ isv
     name   active  main   log uptime
     cgit   no     21637 21636   12 m
    <cron   yes      332   329    3 d>
     rproxy yes      ---   330    ---

On the screen above, we can see that:
  - there are 3 services being currently supervised;
  - the pid of underlying processes are shown in columns "main" & "log";
  - service cgit is disabled (file "down" is present), but it's up;
  - service cron has been up for 3 days;
  - service rproxy is down;
  - service cron is selected to receive control commands.


Interaction
-----------

    KEY       ACTION
    ---       ------
    q         Quit isv
    j/k       Move selection cursor down/up
    <UPPER>   Send command to selected service (e.g. 'U' -> 'up')

That is,  to control a  service, we  first move the  cursor (<>) using  j/k to
select it, then we press SHIFT+x, where x is the first character of one of the
commands supported by sv/svc:
    up, down, once, pause, cont, hup, alarm, interrupt, quit, term, kill


Installation
------------

This is just a single C source file with no external dependencies.
Of course we need Runit/daemontools in order to actually use it.

Do something like this to install:
  $ cc -o isv isv.c
  $ sudo mv isv /usr/bin/


Services Directory
------------------

The base directory for service location can be specified in several ways:
  - if an argument is passed to the isv(1) command, it's the base dir;
  - otherwise, if the SVDIR environment variable is set, it's the base dir;
  - otherwise, the base directory is /service/.

Note: make sure the user running isv(1) has access to service directories.
